I made this project to practice independently using the skills from the Analyst Builder course. As a proud Taiwanese-American, I decided to do some data analytics on Bay Area Bubble Tea statistics. Since I like bubble tea and it's what most people know from Taiwan (that, and semiconductors).

...Also there was two datasets available on Kaggle for 2023 and 2024.
